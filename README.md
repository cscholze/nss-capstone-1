# Chart-It
This app was written to solve my problem of having to maintain a binder
full of song charts.  I wanted an easy way to write some lyrics and add
some chords above it.  Where as websites like 'aczhords.com' or
'ultimate-guitar.com' provide a huge database of songs, I wanted
something more personal that I could log into and manage my own personal
library of song charts.

# Technologies
The app is written using AngularJS as a framework, Bootstrap and Sass for
styling, jTab.js and Raphael.js for the chord lookup, Bower to manage
front end dependencies, Font-Awesome icons, and Firebase as the database
and deployment host.

# Using the app
To use the app, navigate a browser to [Chart-It](https://jcsdevnsscapstone1.firebaseapp.com "Chart-It"),
use an email and password to register (only used to save user libraries) or
login with existing information.
